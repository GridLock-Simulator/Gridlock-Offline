Our General Public Licenses are designed </tspan><tspan x="-452.375" y="395">to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that </tspan><tspan x="-451.8" y="416">you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free </tspan><tspan x="-212.583" y="437">programs, and that you know you can do these things.</tspan><tspan x="0.4" y="458"></tspan><tspan x="-433.99" y="479">To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the </tspan><tspan x="-426.533" y="500">rights.
